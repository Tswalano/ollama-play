### Example Format on GitHub
You can add this as a **ROADMAP.md** file to your GitHub repository or include it directly in your **README.md**.

Additionally, GitHub's built-in project management tools like **Issues**, **Projects**, and **Milestones** can be used to track progress, assign tasks, and collaborate with contributors.

#### **Example Milestone Setup**:
1. Go to the **Issues** tab of your repository.
2. Click on the **Milestones** tab.
3. Click **New Milestone**, and enter the milestone title (e.g., "v1.1 - Improved Chat Interface").
4. Assign related issues or tasks to this milestone.

This provides a structured way of tracking progress in the GitHub repository, and contributors can focus on the specific items under each milestone.
